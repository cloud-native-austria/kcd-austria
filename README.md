## Organizer Decisions

- mutual promotion of KCD Munich and KCD Zurich
- use Sessionize for CfP
- no dedicated speaker slots will be “sold” to sponsors
- using Buffer for social media posts
- we will not tie mentorship/diversity program to "free tickets", it should be a separate program
- we will pay travel & accomodation for keynote speakers
- event MC: Constanze / Daniel
- speakers CfP: Submissions will not be editable after submitting, that will ease the process of reviewing, reviews can happen as soon as something is submitted
- we will do workshops, delivered by individual speakers, applications via CfP
