## Protocol

- Funding
  - Vienna meeting Fund has withdrawn our promised funding of 4800K.
    Reason: the construct with Dynatrace Austria as legal and financial entity, Dynatrace LLC paying for the bills, but not beeing the main organizer
  - New Funding request with Verein in prep -> we only need the bank details
    - delivered today by Erik
  - Payout of last year is ready and can be triggered when the bank account is ready
  - looked into Tito for payments, tickets and lead scanning but that is still ongoing
  - Erik is looking into fundings from "Wirtschaftsagentur"; presumably they are more looking for general MINT events, rather than IT focused events
  - sponsorship contracts are in legal review phase rn
- Website
  - Katharina wil deploy a first (hidden) test version on Friday latest and post it in Slack to get feedback
- Speakers
  - CfP preparations will start as soon as we get Sessionize access
  - rating scheme?
  - please add proposed keynote speakers [here](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-native-austria/projects/6)
  - KCD Logo needs to respect new design -> needs to be approved by CNCF \
    -> important for "public" media
- Thomas fixed the repo/project permissions for the team
