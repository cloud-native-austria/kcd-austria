## Decisions

- No swag bag, just too costly for a decent bag

## Protocol

- Coordination Team [Johannes]
  - Timeplan https://github.com/orgs/cloud-native-austria/projects/11/views/2
  - CNCF Caps/Shirts: yes/no? Shipping quite costly.
    - Possible use cases: Kahoot quiz price or Speaker present/give-away
    - Waiting for feedback if we can aggregate some of these ambassadors packages
  - Swag "teto" bag / Sportsackerl

- Finance Team [Erik]
  - scholarship request: how do we deal with it?
    - CNCF rules: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dkwg7z7HEl6yWdG9ZPRpEhpWkwRYaTDn
    - We don't have means at the moment to do scholarships at the amount

- Marketing Team [Katharina]
  - shared suggestions for tshirts
    - pick in July meeting to get some numbers of costs

- Speaker Organizer Team [Henrik]
  - CfP status: 111 sessions (13 workshops, 1 lightnight), 58 different speakers
  - Mid of June starting the reviews
    - Session leaders will assign reviewers to proposals, balance number of reviewers per proposal
  - For promoting keynote speakers we need abstract, profile, bio. Should be there within the next 2 weeks.
  - CfP Editing emails in inbox
  - Drafting agenda started
    - reducing 15 minutes of break (from last year) in between -> gives probably a weird timing

- Sponsor Organizer Team [Tom]
  - set up sponsor information to be sent out as a heads up
  - reached out to non-active sponsor who haven't signed yet
  - Water-refill: get quotes and maybe TU Wien will take that as sponsorship "stay hydrated for brain work"
  - Espressomobil: getting a quote what it would cost for two days and around 1000 portions, also need weight and size of the mobil for the venue

- Venue Organizer Team [Erik]
  - all fine, nothing new
