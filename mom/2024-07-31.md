## Attendees

## Decisions

- Better speaker information: send out when to be where tech check 10 min. before their talk, slot duration, slot time includes Q&A, USB backups on their own!
  We will not collect slides up front! An optional hint for speakers is that they could record their talk also as a safety net.
