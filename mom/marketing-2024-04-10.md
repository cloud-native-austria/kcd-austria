   - Zurich is already sold out
   - Let's reach out to Munich again
- Logo
  - Edit the blue

- Intro video to be used at the conference & at published videos
  - We need to prepare designs for that:
    - Agenda
    - Signs used at conference
    - Badges (don't forget QR codes)
    - T-Shirts (distinguish participants, speakers, organizers & volunteers depending on price) - have female sizes too, ask for tshirt sizes during registration
- Social Media Graphics
  - Let's use Canva but upload all finished assets to Google Drive
  - Speaker card - distinguish between speakers & keynote speakers
  - Sponsor card
  - Check [timeline](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-native-austria/projects/11/views/2) for additional graphics to create
- Photographer
  - Let's bring it up in the general sync
  - If yes, it would be nice to have pictures of all speakers
- Stickers
  - Let's try to come up with something creative. Doesn't have to be just the logo
