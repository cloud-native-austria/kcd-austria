## Protocol

- Sessionize Access: @henrikrexed do we already have access?
- Keynote Speakers: let's gather potential candidates [here](https://github.com/orgs/cloud-native-austria/projects/6)
  - we should start contacting people at the same time and in a coordinated fashion
- CfP rating system:
  - we are asked to align with the [CNCF scoring guidelines](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2022/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/scoring-guidelines/)
